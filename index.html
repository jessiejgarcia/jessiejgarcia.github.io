       <h2>BIO</h2>
       
       <p> Hello World! My name is Jessie Garcia and I am currently working in Pharmacy.  
           I have done that for about 8 years and it has been quite a ride from retail to a hospital setting.  
           As you can image a certain pandemic has kept me quite busy in the IV room, i will let you guess which one.  
           I feel as though I have accomplished as much as I can in that field now and that chapter maybe coming to a close.  
           I am now turning my attention to the computer programming field and although I am a complete novice, I believe it is the correct path for me.  
           My goals are to become fluent and competent in the full stack approach to programming, 
           so that i might work for myself and have a skill set that is valuable going forward in the ever changing work field. </p>
